# DM - Data Mining and Machine Learning
The research group Data Mining and Machine Learning investigates novel approaches to exploratory data analysis, unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised learning. We focus on methods for various data types including texts, graphs, high-dimensional feature vectors and other complex structures. We consider different tasks, e.g., representation learning, embedding, clustering, causality detection, classification and reinforcement learning.

The research group Data Mining and Machine Learning consists of six work groups:

*   [Univ.-Prof. Dr. Claudia Plant: Data Mining](https://dm.cs.univie.ac.at/index.php?id=1909)
*   [Univ.-Prof. Dr. Benjamin Roth: Natural Language Processing](https://dm.cs.univie.ac.at/index.php?id=1910)
*   [Assoz. Prof. Dr. Nils Kriege: Machine Learning with Graphs](https://dm.cs.univie.ac.at/index.php?id=1911)
*   [Assoz. Prof. Dr. Sebastian Tschiatschek: Probabilistic and Interactive Machine Learning](https://dm.cs.univie.ac.at/index.php?id=1912)
*   Assoz. Prof. Dr. Christian BÃ¶hm : Database Techniques for Data Mining
*   Ass.-Prof. Dr. Yllka Velaj: Scalable Algorithms for Graph Mining

Our methods are inspired by challenges arising from different application areas, e.g. medicine, neuroscience, pharmacoinformatics, renewable energies and social sciences.
